\subsection{Summary}
The following steps have been completed as part of this thesis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design of a functional intermediate language that can be
        easily generated and translated into Overpass
    \item Design of a language for defining CCGs on top of aforementioned
        intermediate language
    \item Implementation of parsers and internal representations for said
        languages
    \item Design, implementation and prooves of correctness for
        a subtyping system and a type variable system for providing
        polymorphism
    \item Implementation and proof of correctness of a Categorial CYK-based
        CCG parser
    \item Implementation of an intermediate language term generator from
        CCG derivation trees
    \item Implementation and proof of termination of a translator from
        intermediate language terms into Overpass programs
    \item Implementation of user interfaces (console and web-based)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future work}
The current implementation is fairly basic and may be extended along multiple
axes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement more Overpass features into the translator to cover a greater
        target domain
    \item Allow assigning weights to CCG rules in order to be able to prioritise
        different parses for the same query
    \item Implement a version of the Vijay-Shanker algorithm for CCG parsing
        in order to improve performance
    \item Avoid $\beta$-reduction on Minipass terms of type $GSet$ in order
        to eliminate some duplicate subqueries
    \item Use Eisner normal form parsing to handle ambiguity better
    \item Use learning methods to automatically extend grammars by using
        query corpora
    \item ...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
Mostly harmless.
