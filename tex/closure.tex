\subsection{Future work}
The current implementation is fairly basic and may be extended along multiple
axes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement more Overpass features into the translator to cover a greater
        target domain
    \item Allow assigning weights to CCG rules in order to be able to prioritise
        different parses for the same query
    \item Implement a version of the Vijay-Shanker algorithm for CCG parsing
        in order to improve performance
    \item Avoid $\beta$-reduction on Minipass terms of type $GSet$ in order
        to eliminate some duplicate subqueries
    \item Use Eisner normal form parsing to handle ambiguity better
    \item Use learning methods to automatically extend grammars by using
        query corpora
    \item ...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
Mostly harmless.
