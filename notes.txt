- make modality restriction clearer by using variables
- make slash indices red
- example sentence for modalities
- clarify usage of free variables when composing derivation tree semantics
- phrase def 18 as "we extend typeof to include those two additional items"
- in examples with trees fix \alpha's and \beta's
- example for subtyping uses lt instead of le
- make lambda^le stand for terms with subtypes instead of lambda^circ
- make def 36 more verbose
- fix definition 33 - not the globally minimal, but minimal on our branch
- fill definition 34
- make cyk' something less conspicous. Explain why it's different: (2) and (3)
  are asymmetric.
- example in def 35 uses covariance instead of contravariance
- add a lot of text to def 36. Actually, instead of clone() we can get an
  arbitrary bijection from ts(tau) onto T\O, can we? Also fix the usage of
  contravariance. NEED A FUCKING EXAMPLE.


to ask:
how to correctly write the overloading in def. 19?
