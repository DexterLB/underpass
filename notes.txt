- can use prolog to parse categorial grammars with ease (but no probabilities)
- context-free subset of a categorial grammar? (nonterminals on left side)
- epsilon rules? (maybe more powerful than the above, allow for example a Filter
  term to be transformed to Set -> Set) by applying the filter function

- think about refining types - how to propagate information about arguments and
  return values? maybe use a unification function to unify input and output
  types and an update function that takes a type and returns a type. Then
  call update on all nodes in the tree, unify types to make it consistent and
  repeat until convergence.
