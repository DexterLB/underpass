fix now:
    - fix def. 2.19 (theta and T), maybe say what exactly is theta
    - def. 2.20 : need to handle sets returned by sem, not terms.
      afterwards, fix the note about contexts
    - fix the shorthand (sets of terms not handled) and make it more concise
    - example 2.1 - explain that we have ambiguity (german cities has 2 categories)
    - example 2.3 : what's the difference between small and small? also sets returned by sem
    - explain that in example 2.7 why we can't do it with variables (different terms)
      also, why do we need to give less-than the semantics of from?
    - fix notation for fancy lambda
    - substitution of type variables in type raising

sections for later:
    - explain about fixed phrases and templates
