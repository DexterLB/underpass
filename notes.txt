- fix semantics of type raising
- definition for mathbb{V} is not a definition. Also defined twice (once for ccg)
- cite vijay-shanker, after it - cite again and refer to paper, explain
  that we don't use it
- performance considerations section
- use a fancier "lambda" symbol for the fancier lambda terms
- make named subtrees fancier
- can't use categories in types: fix semantics definitions to use typeof(), and
  maybe make basic categories distinct from their types
- make slash indices red
