- figure out how to get from trees to lambda expressions with best balance
  between abstraction and pain
- incorporate type raising (decide between unary rules or parametric combination)
- category features and feature variables
- token matching (tagged tokens?)
- way to write grammars (template haskell? parsing?)

ideas:
    - have a fixed starting type system T (e.g. minipass types)
      and allow lexicon-writers to make subtypes of ApplicativeType T.
      Afterwards, lower the terms into ApplicativeType T.
