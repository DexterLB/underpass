- implement topo sort
- add a "cast" operator in LambdaCalculus to support constructing more concrete
  types (essentially newtype)
- simple token matching based on regexes
- incorporate type raising (decide between unary rules or parametric combination)
- token matching (tagged tokens?)
- category features and feature variables

ideas:
    - DECISION TREES for matching tokens! A set of formulae like
      '(matches(stem, <regex>) & verb & !past_tense) | foo | bar'
      can be converted to a decision tree. Conjuncts can even have
      side effects (e.g. matches(..) could set $1 $2 etc). So awesomely
      dirty!
